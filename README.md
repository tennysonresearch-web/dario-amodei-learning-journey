## 🎯 Mission

Transform from AI practitioner to technical leader by following **Dario Amodei's complete research trajectory** from 2005-2025. This repository documents my 12-month journey implementing every major technique, understanding every key paper, and building the same depth of expertise that made Dario one of the most influential figures in AI safety.

**Why Dario's path?** 122,170 citations across 47 papers spanning neuroscience → speech recognition → foundation models → RLHF → constitutional AI → interpretability. It's the most systematic approach to understanding AI from first principles.

## 🔬 Current Implementation: Neural Population Dynamics

### What I'm Building (Month 1-2):

**Maximum Entropy Models for Neural Networks**
```python
from neural_population_dynamics import MaxEntropyNeuralModel

# Fit maximum entropy model to neural spike data
model = MaxEntropyNeuralModel(n_neurons=100)
model.fit(spike_data)

# Generate synthetic neural population activity
synthetic_data = model.sample(n_samples=1000)

# Analyze critical phenomena
from criticality_analysis import CriticalityAnalyzer
analyzer = CriticalityAnalyzer()
avalanches = analyzer.detect_avalanches(spike_data)
criticality_metrics = analyzer.compute_criticality_metrics(avalanches)
```

**Information Theory Tools**
```python
from information_theory_tools import NeuralInformationAnalyzer

analyzer = NeuralInformationAnalyzer()
mi_matrix = analyzer.mutual_information_matrix(spike_trains)
te_network = analyzer.transfer_entropy_network(spike_trains)
```

### Key Papers Being Implemented:
- [x] **"Thermodynamics and signatures of criticality in a network of neurons"** (2015) - 273 citations
- [x] **"The simplest maximum entropy model for collective behavior in a neural network"** (2013) - 177 citations  
- [ ] **"Physical principles for scalable neural recording"** (2013) - 326 citations
